<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md0"></a>
2020-12-12</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md1"></a>
Advanced Motion Control</h2>
<ul>
<li>Simpler all-GUI setup of machine axes, axis transformations and their assignment to Nozzles, Cameras etc. (no more machine.xml hacking).</li>
<li>Making features such as Axis Mapping, Backlash Compensation, Visual Homing, Non-Squareness Compensation etc. available for all types of drivers (formerly just the GcodeDriver).</li>
<li>Allowing multiple drivers of mixed types.</li>
<li>Better control of speed factors: properly control the average speed, including acceleration/deceleration phases. A move at 50% takes exactly twice as long, regardles of how short or long the move is.</li>
<li>Simulated Jerk Control to reduce vibrations, prevent slipping of parts on nozzles, etc.</li>
<li>Experimental: Motion Blending.</li>
<li>Asynchronous communication between OpenPnP and (multiple) controllers. Decoupled and paralellized operation.</li>
<li>Graphical diagnostics for Motion Planning as a basis for fact based machine optimization.</li>
<li>Issues &amp; Solutions system to automatically solve machine specific setup and migration issues, enable advanced features, generate firmware-adapted Gcode commands and regular expressions.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md2"></a>
2020-06-23</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md3"></a>
Actuator API Change (Non-Breaking)</h2>
<ul>
<li>Actuator.actuate(String) has been added, along with support in GcodeDriver. This makes it easy to send completely custom commands from machine object implementations. This is an optional, non-breaking API change.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md4"></a>
2020-05-18</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md5"></a>
Camera Jogging Revert</h2>
<ul>
<li>The old method of camera jogging by clicking and dragging anywhere has been restored. This was removed when camera rotation jogging was adding because it seemed necessary with the new drag handles, but it turns out it's not necessary and the new version was far less convenient.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md6"></a>
2020-05-17</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md7"></a>
Sponsors and About Dialog</h2>
<ul>
<li>The About dialog now includes a Credits tab to thank sponsors of the project. A <a class="el" href="_s_p_o_n_s_o_r_s_8md.html">SPONSORS.md</a> file is also included, which is shown in the dialog. <br  />
</li>
<li>The About menu item is now correctly added to the Help menu on MacOS when the MacOS integrations are not available.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md8"></a>
Installer Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Sample files are now installed by the installer in the user's Documents/OpenPnP directory, instead of in the installation directory. This fixes an issue #836 where users loading the sample files on Windows would experience a write error.</li>
<li>Install4J has been updated from version 6 to 8.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md9"></a>
2020-04-29</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md10"></a>
Advanced Camera Settle</h2>
<p>Camera Autosettle is now exposed on the GUI, it was significantly expanded to allow for different methods in image processing and for settling quantification. Graphical diagnostics and image replay with motion "heat map" are provided.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md11"></a>
Advanced Part On/Off Detection</h2>
<p>Vacuum sensing part-on/part-off detection was significantly expanded to allow for differencial vacuum level assessment and adaptive dwell times. Graphical diagnostics are provided.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md12"></a>
2020-04-20</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md13"></a>
Improved Actuator Read Errors</h2>
<p>Actuator reads are used for a number of subsystems in OpenPnP, and this feature tends to be confusing to configure. Previously, a misconfigured actuator read would often result in a cryptic NullPointerException that was difficult to debug. This system has now been improved so that the Actuator will report the three most common errors: missing command, missing regex, and unmatched response.</p>
<p>Additionally, actuatorRead() will no longer return null under any circumstance. It will either return a valid string (which may be empty) or throw a descriptive error.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md14"></a>
GcodeDriver Test Framework</h2>
<p>A new GcodeServer class has been added, along with a number of small GcodeDriver based tests. The GcodeServer in combination with the test system allows end to end automated testing of complex features such as Actuators.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md15"></a>
2020-04-12</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md16"></a>
OpenCV Upgrade</h2>
<p>OpenCV has been upgraded to 4.3.0-0. This is a major update (for OpenCV) and may introduce new issues. This is a necessary step on the way to Java 10+ support.</p>
<p>Note that support for 32 bit Linux has been dropped from the OpenCV package due to difficulty of maintenance. If you are using 32 bit Linux please make it known.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md17"></a>
2020-04-02</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md18"></a>
Vacuum and Blow Off Levels</h2>
<p>You can now specify vacuum and blow off levels on packages. These values are used to trigger actuators when picking (vacuum level) and placing (blow off level).</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/965">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/965</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Thanks Thomas!</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md19"></a>
2020-01-22</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md20"></a>
Camera Jogging Update</h2>
<p>A new camera jogging system has been implemented which allows for rotation and better precision for XY. See <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TvqQBkTGP8">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TvqQBkTGP8</a> for details.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md21"></a>
2019-12-03</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md22"></a>
New feeder: ReferenceLeverFeeder</h2>
<p>This is for feeders where a lever is pushed by a actuator (usually the head) to advance the parts. It was made from the ReferenceDragFeeder. A Part Pitch field is added and multiple feed operations will be performed as required.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md23"></a>
2019-11-24</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md24"></a>
BREAKING CHANGE: Vacuum Valve and Pump Actuation Remodel</h2>
<p>Vacuum valves and pump actuation is now modeled with Actuators and <br  />
 made independent from pick() and place() functionality and from the Driver. The changes refine and unify the machine model and ease the development of new capabilities. The new ContactProbeNozzle demonstrates this by adding contact probing to pick() and place() which allows for more tolerance and robustness in the Z height handling of parts, feeders and the PCB.</p><ul>
<li>The vacuum Actuator is no longer just used to read the vacuum pressure level but also to actuate the valve (Boolean).</li>
<li>The Nozzle's pick() and place() methods will actuate the valve Actuators as needed.</li>
<li>At the same time the Nozzle's pick() and place() methods are now dedicated to what their names imply, making vacuum switching independent from them.</li>
<li>Consequently the Nozzle pick() or place() can now do more than just actuate the vacuum, they can also be properly sub-classed/overridden for extended functionality.</li>
<li>In turn the valve Actuator is now used independently to test if a part if off after placement. An "in-the-air" pick() and place() cycle is no longer used, avoiding unexpected behavior when pick() and place() do more than vacuum switching.</li>
<li>Users can also use the Machine Controls' Actuators tab to test the valve Actuator independently and to simulate and determine part on/part off vacuum readings.</li>
<li>A new pump Actuator is added to the head. It will actuate the pump as needed.</li>
<li>The pick() and place() methods in turn govern the pump Actuator, i.e. as long as at least one part is on a nozzle, the pump will be switched on.</li>
<li>Users can also use the Machine Controls Actuators tab to test the pump Actuator.</li>
<li>All pick(), place(), pump and valve actuation are removed from the Driver.</li>
<li>Consequently the PICK_COMMAND, PLACE_COMMAND, PUMP_ON_COMMAND, PUMP_OFF_COMMAND are deprecated in the GCodeDriver. They will no longer work but the fragments are available in the GUI for G-Code migration to the Actuators (these entries will be removed end of 2021).</li>
<li>In turn the new Actuators define their G-Code in the proper ACTUATE_BOOLEAN_COMMAND fragments.</li>
<li>Users must add the new pump Actuator and revisit the vacuum reading Actuator and migrate their G-Code there.</li>
<li>To ease the now more important plug-and-play of Actuators, they can now be assigned by ComboBoxes rather than by loose name references.</li>
<li>As a first benefit from the changes, the new ContactProbeNozzle subclasses the ReferenceNozzle and adds a contact probe to sense when the nozzle tip hits the target i.e. when the pick() makes contact with the part in the feeder or when the place() hits the PCB with the part on the nozzle (the Liteplacer has such a probing nozzle). This allows for more tolerance and robustness towards variances in Z height of parts, feeders and the PCB. Users can more quickly (i.e. more roughly) setup Z heights.</li>
<li>More information, guidance and screenshots can be seen in the PR: <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/859#issue-290920991">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/859#issue-290920991</a></li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md25"></a>
ReferenceStripFeeder Vision Bug Fix</h2>
<p>A long standing bug in ReferenceStripFeeder has been fixed by @tjanuszewski in <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/919">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/pull/919</a>. If you have struggled with the vision on ReferenceStripFeeder in the past, especially on longer strips, please give it a new try as this fix seems to improve it's functionality greatly.</p>
<p>Thank you @tjanuszewski for finding and fixing this!</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md26"></a>
2019-06-13</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md27"></a>
New Scripting Events</h2>
<p>Added several new scripting events for pick and place events:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nozzle.BeforePick</li>
<li>Nozzle.AfterPick</li>
<li>Nozzle.BeforePlace</li>
<li>Nozzle.AfterPlace</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md28"></a>
2019-06-12</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md29"></a>
Switcher Camera and Camera Interface Changes</h2>
<p>This update adds a new camera type called a SwitcherCamera. This camera is a virtual camera that allows you to have multiple virtual cameras sharing the same physical capture device. This is a common configuration on commercial desktop pick and place machines, where a single capture card captures images from two analog cameras. A serial command is used to switch which camera is currently streaming.</p>
<p>Some small changes were also made to the camera interface in general. Two new methods were added:</p><ul>
<li>Camera.captureForPreview(): Captures an image and applies transforms, but does not perform scripting or lighting events.</li>
<li>Camera.captureRaw(): Returns a raw image from the capture device, with no transforms.</li>
</ul>
<p>The first is mainly for future expansion - in the near future changes will be made to how camera streaming works to improve performance and make the cameras more context sensitive.</p>
<p>The second is added specifically for the new SwitcherCamera, so that it can get raw images from the source camera. This new method is also being used to clean up and consolidate the camera code across various camera implementations.</p>
<p>In general, if you aren't using the SwitcherCamera you shouldn't notice any differences with this update. If you notice new problems with cameras, please report an issue.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/SwitcherCamera">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/SwitcherCamera</a> for more information.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md31"></a>
Global Nozzle Tip Update</h2>
<p>The nozzle tip system has been overhauled so that nozzle tips belong to the machine, rather than to each nozzle. This removes the need to duplicate nozzle tips for each nozzle, and better fits how nozzle changers typically work.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can now easily set package compatibility directly from the packages panel.</p>
<p>This is a large, breaking change. For more information on why this change happened, please see: <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/183">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/183</a></p>
<p>Thank you to @markmaker for reviewing and for merging in his recent calibration changes. He has also provided some help for migrating:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy the big <code>&lt;nozzle-tips/&gt;</code> XML block to the right place (I took a default OpenPNP 2.0 <code>machine.xml</code> as a guide).</li>
<li>start OpenPNP again and again, note the elements/attributes no longer supported and delete them (would be so nice to have a command-line option for the XML parser to ignore unknown elements and attributes, but it seems the parser in OpenPNP has no such thing*)</li>
<li>define nozzle tip to nozzle compatibility on the Nozzle</li>
<li>learn the new way to change nozzle tips (by clicking the checkbox in the list)</li>
<li>define vacuum levels not forgetting the fact that isPartOff is now measured with opened valve for a moment (but see #855).</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md33"></a>
Runout Compensation and Bottom Camera Position and Rotation Calibration</h2>
<p>Feature changes:</p><ul>
<li>Using the Runout calibration facility, an automatic bottom camera position and rotation offset calibration is provided. In a multi-nozzle machine, this should be done with the first/best nozzle.</li>
<li>For all the other nozzles in a multi-nozzle machine, a new "Model &amp; Camera Offset" calibration system is provided, compensating for any offset introduced through imperfect Z travel when the bottom camera focal plane does not match the PCB surface plane.</li>
<li>The user can not set how many missed vision detections are tolerated in Runout Calibration for more robustness inside a job.</li>
<li>The user can set a Z offset for calibrate per nozzle tip to allow the focal plane of the vision-detected feature to be further up on the nozzle tip (e.g. receded air hole in a cup shaped nozzle tip).</li>
<li>If a nozzle tip is named "unloaded" it is used as a stand-in when no nozzle tip is loaded. Very useful when the nozzle tip holder itself has so much runout that even nozzle tip changing is scary without calibration. Again use the Z offset to calibrate the bare nozzle tip holder in the focal plane.</li>
<li>User settable automatic recalibration trigger:<ul>
<li>On each nozzle tip change</li>
<li>On each nozzle tip change if used in a job (like before)</li>
<li>On homing/first change of a nozzle tip after homing. Nozzle tips that are later unloaded and reloaded will not be recalibrated, saving time. This assumes that both the nozzle (i.e. the C axis) and the nozzle tip in the holder will retain a known rotation (i.e. the runout phase shift does not change).</li>
<li>On manual calibration only. The compensation is stored in the machine.xml which is useful for machines that have a homed/spring-loaded rotation C axes so the runout phase shift remains the same on every power up.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Fixes:</p><ul>
<li>Removed unnecessary start/stop rotations in calibration</li>
<li>Changed the threshold property into a unit-aware Length</li>
<li>Fixed missing LengthUnit conversions in the "Model" calibration system (it compensated in millimeters but based its model on camera units).</li>
<li>Fixed camera not updating its width/height when the frame size changes due to changed transformations such as rotation (like after the above-mentioned rotation calibration). VisionUtils performed bad pixel to Location coordinate conversions until the next OpenPNP restart.</li>
</ul>
<p>Changes in models and utility functions:</p><ul>
<li>Added a home() method to all HeadMountables to trigger recalibration when needed.</li>
<li>Added a Camera.getLocation(tool) method to get a camera position adjusted for a specific nozzle/nozzle tip. This helps with multi-nozzle machines that have the bottom camera focal plane at a Z height that differs from the PCB surface. Therefore the different nozzles might introduce a slight offset due to the Z axes not being perfectly perallel to each other.</li>
<li>Added reverse transformation in VisionUtils (Location to pixel)</li>
<li>Added "center" property to vision stage MaskCircle to allow off-center nozzle tip recognition for camera calibration.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md35"></a>
OpenPnP 2.0 Ongoing Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Actuators are now added to the tools dropdown in jog controls so that you can select one and move it. This is probably a temporary change as this dropdown will go away in the future, but for the time being it helps with setting up drag feeders.</li>
<li>Swapped positions of "capture" and "move" buttons wherever those buttons are grouped together, and added a separator between the two groups of buttons. This is intended to make it a little less easy to accidentally click the capture buttons, which many people have recognized as being a UX problem.</li>
<li>Moved the "Feed" button on the Feeders panel to the front of the list as this is the most common action.</li>
<li>Split the reference nozzle and reference nozzle tip configuration wizards into separate panels. This is will make it easier to refactor for global nozzles.</li>
<li>Added basic Z Probing by setting actuator name on head.</li>
<li>Added canned cycle for getting a Z Probe at a location.</li>
<li>Z Probe is now automatically performed, if enabled, when capturing a camera location. This results in a fully formed location capture including Z. If no Z Probe is available Z is left unchanged.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md37"></a>
OpenPnP 2.0</h2>
<p>This update includes a large number of major changes to how OpenPnP works, along with several breaking changes. Because of the severity of the changes I am calling this OpenPnP 2.0.</p>
<p>Please read the release notes carefully before using it, and please back up your configuration directory, job, and board files. Some of the changes will modify your files and you will not be able to go back to the older version without restoring your backups.</p>
<ul>
<li>JobProcessor Rewrite: The JobProcessor has been rewritten from the ground up to solve a number of long standing bugs and issues. The new version allows for finer granularity in steps, better error handling - including context sensitive errors, better retry options for pick and feed failures, improved vacuum checking, and increased flexibility.<ul>
<li>The FSM implementation that caused the "No defined state from..." type errors has been removed completely. Fixes #695.</li>
<li>Each step is now in it's own class, and maintains it's own state. This lets each step determine what level of granularity it wants to expose.</li>
<li>Steps now direct the job processor to the next step when they finish, making it very easy to add customized steps and to retry when things fail.</li>
<li><p class="startli">The JobProcessor interface now returns a custom exception type that includes a source. In general these sources will be instances of model or SPI objects such as Nozzle, Feeder, Part, Placement, etc. This makes it possible to help the user find the source of the error in the UI.</p>
<p class="startli">A future update will include a new "Production" panel that will let you quickly jump to the source of an error.</p>
</li>
<li>Granularity has been greatly improved in several long running steps. Fiducials, and pick, primarily. Now clicking stop during a fiducial check will not continue checking every board before stopping. <br  />
</li>
<li>Vacuum checking is now performed in the job processor, instead of in the nozzle. With this change additional vacuum checks have been added as well. Vacuum is now checked after pick, after bottom vision, before place, and after place. In addition, the after pick check is now performed after lifting the nozzle for better accuracy and the after place check is performed with vacuum turned on.</li>
<li><p class="startli">Feed retry and pick retry are now separate steps.</p>
<p class="startli">Feed retry allows retry of a feeder that has an error while feeding, such as a vision failure on the strip feeder, or a hardware error on an auto feeder.</p>
<p class="startli">Pick retry handles retry of the entire pick sequence. This is primarily a factor when using vacuum sensing. After a part is picked, if the vacuum sensing system does not detect the part on the nozzle a discard cycle is performed and the entire feed / pick cycle is restarted.</p>
</li>
<li>These changes fix #280.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>BREAKING CHANGE: Changed the vacuum sensing levels from the trio of logic inverted, part on level, and part off level to a dual range for on low/high and off low/high.</li>
<li>BREAKING CHANGE: Removed job auto save and config auto safe from the job processor. This feature caused a serious performance hit and cluttered up the job processor. This feature will be added back at a later date with a new implementation that does not harm performance.</li>
<li><p class="startli">BREAKING CHANGE: Removed "Check Fids?" from the placements panel, and it's functionality from the job processor. This feature was originally meant to be a way to check local fids around important placements but it was not implemented correctly and was not generally useful. PRs welcome to add true local fid checking.</p>
<p class="startli">This change should not break any jobs or configurations, but I've labeled it a breaking change to get the attention of anyone who was using the feature for further discussion.</p>
</li>
<li>BREAKING CHANGE: The park when complete option has been removed and park when complete is now always performed. <b>You must set a park location before running a job on this version.</b> This is a preperatory change for more automation in machine movements in general. It will become much more important that the machine knows where it can safely park.</li>
<li>BREAKING CHANGE: Removed the isPartOn and isPartOff variables from the GcodeDriver. This is better handled by the main vacuum system. It would be possible to add the new vacuum variables to GcodeDriver, so if someone is depending on this functionality please speak up.</li>
<li><p class="startli">BREAKING CHANGE: Placement Type "Ignore" has been moved to Placement Enabled. The Type field will be used only for specifying Placement or Fiducial, and a new Enabled field has been added. This makes it easier to disable placements for a job without losing whether that placement is a fiducial or a placement.</p>
<p class="startli">Additionally, Type Place has been renamed to Placement.</p>
<p class="startli">This change is backwards compatible but not forwards compatible. If you open and save a job using this version you will not be able to open it with an older version.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">BREAKING CHANGE: The Paste Dispense feature has been removed entirely. This feature is used by by very few people, does not work well, and is not well maintained. Removing the feature allows OpenPnP to focus on the pick and place user experience without having to maintain backwards compatibility with paste dispense.</p>
<p class="startli">A version of OpenPnP with Paste Dispense will be saved and will be made available for users to download if they need that functionality for an existing setup. That version will receive no future updates.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Added a new error handling system that allows users to specify on a placement by placement basis how errors should be handled. The options are Alert and Suppress.</p>
<p class="startli">Alert will raise the error immediately and pause the job. The user must fix the problem before continuing.</p>
<p class="startli">Suppress will mark the placement errored and continue on without alerting the user. When the job finishes the list of errored placements is printed. The user can then fix errors and re-run the job to fix unplaced placements.</p>
<p class="startli">In the very near future there will be a GUI added that shows the errored placements at the end of the job so that you can see what needs to be fixed to finish the job.</p>
</li>
<li>Removed Skip, Ignore and Continue, and Try Again from the Job error dialog. Now the error is shown and the job is paused. The user can make adjustments to the job and start it again to recovery from the error.</li>
<li>Refactored vacuum sensing to Nozzle.isPartOn() and Nozzle.isPartOff(). Fixes #753, and #102.</li>
<li>Removed the post pre-flight nozzle tip calibration from job processor. I can't see why this would be useful since the planner may immediately change out the nozzle tips. Calibration is now performed after tip changes for any tips that are not already calibrated. If this change is detrimental to your setup please speak up. <br  />
</li>
<li>Added missing signaler signals for job running and stopped. <br  />
</li>
<li>Increased the speed of the demo driver to make the demo a little more fun to watch. <br  />
</li>
<li>Fix tooltips and button names on footprint pads. <br  />
</li>
<li>Renamed Feeder.retryCount to Feeder.feedRetryCount.</li>
<li>Added Feeder.pickRetryCount.</li>
<li>Changed hardcoded pick retry in job processor to use Feeder.pickRetryCount.</li>
<li>Coming Soon: There are a number of other features that are based on this work, which are coming very soon.<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Production Tab: Job controls will be moved from the Job tab to a new Production tab. The Production tab will include status about the running job in total, and status for each placement being processed by the job.</p>
<p class="startli">The Production tab will also include a list of placements that have errored during processing and will allow the user to quickly jump to the source of the error.</p>
<p class="startli">The Placement Status and Placed? columns will also move to this tab. After this change the Job panel will be mostly used for Job editing before starting a job, and will be mostly read only during a job run.</p>

Bottom Vision Pre-Rotate Updates and Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Bottom Vision Pre-Rotate now stores the rotation offset in the PartAlignmentOffset allowing Pre-Rotate Bottom Vision with multiple nozzles sharing a C axis.</li>
<li>The angle calculation is unified and simplified with regard to math laws (distributive modulo equivalences).</li>
<li>Pre-Rotate Bottom Vision is done in a multi-pass loop until a good fix is obtained.</li>
<li>X, Y offsets are obtained together with the rotation offset, so with a good fix only one vision pass is needed (formerly two needed). This way Pre-Rotate Bottom Vision becomes as fast as Post-Rotate in most cases.</li>
<li>The maximum allowed linear center and corner offset as well as the angular offset can be configured (GUI). If the allowed offsets are not met, an additional compensation &amp; vision pass is done. A maximum number of passes can be configured.</li>
<li>The use of Pre-Rotate can now be overridden per Part (Default, Always on, Always off). <br  />
</li>
<li>A bug in Test Align was fixed, where the part height was not added to Z i.e. the part held too close to the camera.</li>
</ul>

New Job Planner</h2>
<p>A new Job Planner is being tested. The SimplePnpJobPlanner replaces the StandardPnpJobPlanner as the new default. The new planner attempts to fill as many nozzles as possible per cycle, and tries to limit the number of nozzle tip changes, but does not try as hard to "look ahead" as the old planner.</p>
<p>The upside is that the new planner is much, much faster and works for jobs of any size, while the old planner would fail on jobs larger than a few hundred placements when multiple nozzles were in use.</p>
<p>The downside is that the new planner may perform more total cycles, and may perform more nozzle tip changes, although in testing so far it seems to perform pretty similarly for a number of common configurations.</p>
<p>The new planner is enabled by default. Please give it a try and report if you run into any issues. If you need to switch back to the old planner, you can edit machine.xml and change</p>
<p><code>&lt;planner class="org.openpnp.machine.reference.ReferencePnpJobProcessor$SimplePnpJobPlanner"/&gt;</code></p>
<p>to</p>
<p><code>&lt;planner class="org.openpnp.machine.reference.ReferencePnpJobProcessor$StandardPnpJobPlanner"/&gt;</code></p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md44"></a>
New Job Planner Interface</h2>
<p>As indicated above, the Job Planner interface is back and it is now possible to write custom planners and plug them in using the method described above. This interface is not final, and will likely undergo some small changes in the future, but the basic concept should remain the same.</p>
<p>See either of the two planners described above for an example of how to write one.</p>

High Profile Bugs Fixes and Updates</h2>
<p>A few important bug fixes for long standing bugs are now in, along with some long standing feature requests:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">"No defined transitions from Preflight to Initialize": There were a number of errors related to state management in the JobPanel FSM and these are now corrected. The primary cause of this error was clicking Job buttons while an action was already taking place. State is now managed correctly, and more importantly, the buttons are disabled while operations that can't be interrupted are taking place.</p>
<p class="startli">This is a significant change that is hard to test under every condition, so please let us know if you run into issues with this.</p>
<p class="startli">See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/478">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/478</a> for more info.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">"Stopping a job should stop the job as soon as possible": This issue was related to how the job would continue for a time after pressing pause or stop. In general, once a pick and place cycle started it could not be interrupted. In addition, the startup process of a job would be impossible to interrupt. This is now fixed and granularity of steps is increased. Clicking pause or stop will now stop the job as soon as the current operation is complete.</p>
<p class="startli">See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/278">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/278</a> for more info.</p>
</li>
<li>Multi-select tables and right click menus: All of the primary tables now support multi-select and right click menus. This makes it much easier to enable / disable a number of feeders at once, or set the "Check Fids" for multiple boards at once, for instance.</li>
</ul>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md48"></a>
Major Change: Fiducial System (Affine Transforms)</h2>
<p>The fiducial system has undergone extensive changes to support compensating for scale and shear in boards. When three or more fiducials are available, three will be used during the fiducial check and this data is used to calculate much better positions for placements. This should result in an overall accuracy improvement when using three fiducials.</p>
<p>In addition, the two fiducial system is now using the same code, minus shear processing, so it should show an improvement in accuracy as well when using two fiducials. The difference will not be as significant as when using three.</p>
<p>Note that board locations are no longer updated when performing fiducial checks. The fiducial data is used in real time to calculate placement positions, rather than relying on the board location. This means that if you perform a fiducial check and then move to the board location, the board may not look perfectly aligned, but when you move to a placement it will be correct.</p>
<p>The fiducial check will still position the camera over the located board origin at the end of the process so that there can be visual verification of success.</p>
<p>In general, users should not notice any differences in using the new system aside from overall better accuracy.</p>

<p>This above changes are complete. There are a few remaining related tasks which are:</p><ul>
<li>Implement transform for the two point board locator.</li>
<li>Add an indication to the user when a board has been located.</li>
<li>Verify compatibility with panels.</li>
<li>Implement inverted transform in calculateBoardPlacementLocationInverse so that manual training benefits from the transform.</li>

Breaking Change: Park System</h2>
<p><b>Please reset your park locations!</b></p>
<p>The Park system has had a number of breaking changes made. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Park XY now always parks the head at the same location, regardless of what tool is selected in the jog control dropdown. This ensures that if you choose a park location with one tool selected and then attempt to park with a different tool selected you don't crash the head. This is primarily a safety improvement.</li>
<li>Z and Rotation have been removed from the park head configuration since these are each specific to the tool being parked.</li>
<li>Park Z now parks the selected tool at Safe Z instead of the Z entered in the head configuration.</li>
<li>Park Rotation now parks the selected tool's rotation at 0 instead of the Rotation entered in the head configuration.</li>
</ul>
<p>The overall goal and result of these changes is to ensure that park always parks at the exact same location no matter what tool is selected.</p>
<p>See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/279">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/279</a> for more information.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md53"></a>
New Feature: XY Soft Limits</h2>

This option, which is on by default, can be turned off to cause OpenPnP to close the serial port or TCP port when clicking the disable button. This makes it possible to connect to the serial port from another program without having to exit OpenPnP.</p>

<p class="startli">There is a new default pipeline that performs well for non-polarized, rectangular components such as resistors and capacitors.</p>
<p class="startli">It attempts to include the electrodes as well as the bodies to better recognize rectangular parts and it performs landscape orientation on the results so that there is a deterministic orientation for rectangular parts.</p>
<p class="startli">The camera feedback is now only shown at the end of the process, and for a longer time. This better represents what OpenPnP is "seeing" before it picks the part.</p>

<p class="startli">Pre Move Command in GcodeDriver Axes now has a Coordinate variable which can be used to reset an axis' position before moving it. This can be used in controller firmwares that do not support individual variables for multiple axes. In particular, this makes it possible to use Marlin with multiple rotation axes by using a Pre Move Command like <code>T0G92E{Coordinate:%.4f}</code></p>

<p class="startli">As a result of the discussion in <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/openpnp/7029bade-fa16-46e5-8c2d-d9e22105c5fe%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&utm_source=footer">https://groups.google.com/d/msgid/openpnp/7029bade-fa16-46e5-8c2d-d9e22105c5fe%40googlegroups.com?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=footer</a> several changes have been made to the vision pipeline system.</p><ul>
<li>ReferenceBottomVision now looks for it's results in a stage named "results", like the other primary vision operations. It also falls back to "result" for backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>ReferenceBottomVision now has improved error messages when a result is not found, or when the result in not in the correct format. This should help users as they experiment with new pipelines.</li>
<li>Vision operations all now reference a common name to avoid mistakes like this in the future.</li>

<li><p class="startli">Major Update: New Camera Capture System!</p>
<p class="startli">OpenPnP now has it's very own, custom written camera capture system written specifically to solve all of the problems that have plagued camera capture since the beginning of this project!</p>
<p class="startli">openpnp-capture is a brand new capture library written by Niels Moseley (@trcwm) specifically for OpenPnP. Using this library we are now finally able to do things like run multiple USB cameras on a single port/hub, manage camera properties such as exposure, focus and white balance and select camera data formats to make intelligent choices based on quality, size, frame rate, etc.</p>
<p class="startli">Two of the biggest difficulties with capture in OpenPnP from the start have been the inability to run multiple cameras over a single USB port/hub and the inability to control manual exposure. The first is important because many people use OpenPnP with laptops which may have a limited number of ports. The second is important because most commercial USB cameras default to auto exposure and this causes problems with vision as the camera adjusts the exposure to compensate for differences in the image.</p>
<p class="startli">Using the new library, you can now set up your lighting and choose the exact exposure that works best for your machine, and you will know that it won't change just because the camera is looking at something else.</p>
<p class="startli">To use the new feature, add a new camera using the OpenPnpCaptureCamera and see the General Settings tab to select a device, format and property settings.</p>
<p class="startli">I want to give a HUGE shout out and thank you to Niels for all his incredibly hard work on the new capture library over the past couple months. He wrote a robust and expansive library for video capture for all three major operating systems in a very short period of time, knocking out feature after feature faster than I could integrate them into OpenPnP. This is an invaluable contribution to the project and will really push OpenPnP forward in it's computer vision abilities. Thank you Niels!</p>
<p class="startli">For more information about the capture library itself, see: <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-capture">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-capture</a></p>
<p class="startli">For information about the Java and Maven bindings for the capture library, see: <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-capture-java">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp-capture-java</a></p>
<p class="startli">Finally, be aware that there are some known issues:</p><ul>
<li>When you switch the selected device, the wizard doesn't reload the properties. To work around, simply click to another wizard and then click back. To be fixed soon.</li>
<li>Brightness, contrast, saturation, gamma properties not yet implemented in OpenPnP. These properties were recently added to the capture library but have not yet been implemented in OpenPnp.</li>
</ul>

<p class="startli">You can right click the placements table to perform a bulk set or reset of the Placed flag and there is a new Job menu item that will reset the Placed status for the entire job at once. This can be used to quickly prep the job to be run again after it's finished.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Improved Nozzle Changer Speed Support</p>
<p class="startli">With thanks to @lilltroll77 we now have improved nozzle changer speed control. The speed controls added recently had a limitation where different speeds would be used for different parts of the movement. You can now define three speeds that are used between the four movements and they are applied during those transitions whether it is for load or unload.</p>
<p class="startli">Note that since the configuration has changed slightly for this feature, you should check your speed settings before running a nozzle change with this new version. Settings should be migrated over automatically, but it is prudent to check them before using.</p>
<p class="startli">More information about this change is available at: <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/584">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/584</a></p>

<p class="startli">This allows users to easily edit the vision pipeline for fiducials, making it easy to customize for different board and lighting scenarios. Pipeline editing works the same as in bottom vision; you can edit the pipeline on a part by part basis or at a global default.</p>
<p class="startli">The default pipeline included with OpenPnP is an exact duplicate of the code that used to be used internally - it has just been converted to pipeline form to make it editable.</p>

<li><p class="startli">CvPipeline Properties (Breaking Change)</p>
<p class="startli">In an effort to make it easier for developers to integrate custom functionality in CvPipelines, the pipeline now has a map of properties that can be set be callers. This allows callers of a pipeline to feed values in for the pipeline to use. This can be things like cameras, feeders, parts, nozzles, etc.</p>
<p class="startli">This functionality replaces the previously added setFeeder and setNozzle calls. These calls were too specific to certain pipelines and did not represent a good development direction for the pipeline as it would eventually become cluttered with variables that did not make sense for the pipeline as a whole.</p>
<p class="startli">Breaking Change: All existing stages have been migrated to the property system. If you have custom stages that used getNozzle or getFeeder you will need to make minor updates to switch these to use properties instead.</p><ul>
<li>getNozzle() becomes (Nozzle) getProperty("nozzle")</li>
<li>getFeeder() becomes (Feeder) getProperty("feeder")</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Finally, this change is the first step into supporting variables in CvPipeline. Eventually you will be able to reference properties and other objects when setting parameters in stages.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Tool Selection for Cameras</p>
<p class="startli">Thanks to @BendRocks an old feature has been brought back to life. You can now select head mounted cameras from the Machine Controls tool dropdown box. This causes the DROs to show the coordinates of the camera and allows you to jog from the camera's perspective instead of just the nozzle's. This also makes it possible (although not yet implemented) to do the same kind of thing for paste dispensers when that feature is revived.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Auto Panelization</p>
<p class="startli">Thanks to @BendRocks we now have a robust panelization solution in OpenPnP! Panels allow you to quickly set up multiple copies of a board in an array and allow you to have panel fiducials in addition to board fiducials. There is also a quick X out feature that makes it easy to mark boards in the array that are damaged and should not be placed.</p>
<p class="startli">This feature is a work in progress. There are some known issues and some limitations but it has matured enough that it's ready for people to start trying it out.</p>
<p class="startli">Full documentation for this feature is coming soon and will be available at: <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Panelization">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Panelization</a></p>

<li><p class="startli">Job Placement Status</p>
<p class="startli">With many thanks to @iAmRoland we now have a great status display of placements as a job is run. Their description from the pull request describes the feature nicely:</p>
<p class="startli">&gt; Once the start button is pressed, it will mark all pending placements with a yellow color. &gt; When it's processing a placement it will display a blue color on the ID cell. Once it's done &gt; with all placements with the same ID, it then marks that cell with a green color. If no &gt; placement is going to be done then the cell is left white.</p>
<p class="startli">@iAmRoland even included a nice GIF that shows how it looks: <a href="https://camo.githubusercontent.com/954ded479f650507bece8c199c7b73233708097e/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d6c4130716d6b2e6a7067">https://camo.githubusercontent.com/954ded479f650507bece8c199c7b73233708097e/687474703a2f2f692e696d6775722e636f6d2f6d6c4130716d6b2e6a7067</a></p>

<li><p class="startli">Auto Update Fixed, Version Number Improvements</p>
<p class="startli">An error that was causing the auto updater to not work has been fixed. In the process, the OpenPnP version numbering scheme has been changed and improved. Version numbers were previously just an inscrutable Git hash. They are now in the format of 2017-03-26_18-56-32.0be8a03, with the part before the period representing the date of the build and the part after the period representing the Git hash. This makes it easy to identify when the code was built and how old it is, and the Git hash can be used to identify a specific commit.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Generalized Vacuum Sensing (BREAKING CHANGE)</p>
<p class="startli">Vacuum sensing was previously a GcodeDriver only feature. With the recent Actuator Improvements it became possible to extend this feature to all drivers. The vacuum sense feature now uses an Actuator to read values from the pressure sensor, instead of a specialized GcodeDriver command.</p>
<p class="startli">Configuration is still similar. Instead of defining a VACUUM_REQUEST_COMMAND and VACUUM_REPORT_REGEX you just create an Actuator that uses the same values and set the Actuator name on your nozzle.</p>
<p class="startli">Due to this configuration change, this is a breaking change. Your vacuum sense will not work until you make the manual changes. You can watch a short video tutorial showing how to make the required changes at: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsZ5dy7n1Ag">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FsZ5dy7n1Ag</a></p>

<p class="startli">ReferenceAutoFeeder can now use actuators in boolean or double mode and the configuration panel has been updated to support each.</p>
<p class="startli">ReferenceAutoFeeder also now supports a post pick actuator, which is helpful to support feeders that require two movements for a single feed operation. This is common in the Yamaha CL feeders that are becoming popular. The feed actuator is used to retract the guard and the post pick actuator is used to advance the tape after a pick.</p>
<p class="startli">Existing feeders should not require any changes to support these new features. The defaults have been maintained.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Post Pick Supported in Feeder Panel</p>
<p class="startli">The post pick operation is now called from the Feeders tab when you run a Pick operation. This is useful when testing feeders that use this feature. Prior to this addition the post pick operation was only called when a job was running.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Help Menu</p>
<p class="startli">There is now a new Help menu that has quick links to important documentation and a new option to let you check for updates to OpenPnP. This option is only enabled if you installed OpenPnP with the installer. It will not be available if you built it from source.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Camera Improvements</p>
<p class="startli">ReferenceCamera is now much smarter about handling problems with invalid images and it should no longer cause high CPU usage when a camera configuration is incorrect. In addition, when it receives a null image it will retry up to 10 times before failing. This is helpful for cameras that sometimes return bad images; common with the ELP series of USB cameras.</p>

<li><p class="startli">User Interface Improvements</p>
<p class="startli">This change introduces a new layout and some changes to the main user interface. The purpose of this change is to improve use of screen real estate for the things that people spend the most time interacting with.</p>
<p class="startli">The main change is that the screen is now split vertically instead of horizontally. Cameras have been moved to the upper left and jog controls to the lower left. The tabs and tables have been moved to the right side of the screen and are now stacked rather than side by side.</p>
<p class="startli">The primary benefit of this change is that it takes better advantage of the trend towards wider screens. Previously, users with wide (but short) screens had very limited space to work in due to the fixed sizes of several components. With the screen now split vertically it is now possible to use the full height of the screen to see jobs, placements and configuration information.</p>
<p class="startli">Other minor changes are:</p><ul>
<li>You can now collapse the jog controls to get them out of the way if you prefer to use the keyboard shortcuts or camera jogging.</li>
<li>DROs have been moved from the Machine Controls section to the bottom right of the status bar. For too long the DROs have taken up a huge amount of screen space for something that is really not that useful. You can still switch between relative and absolute mode by clicking on them.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Here are some screenshots to show the major differences. The first shows the interface before the changes, the next shows the new user interface with jog controls expanded and the third shows the new interface with jog controls collapsed.</p>
<p class="startli"><img src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1182323/21372675/562c4ae6-c6de-11e6-8071-86b126f78b95.png" alt="screen shot 2016-12-20 at 5 53 55 pm" class="inline"/></p>

<p class="startli">Finally, I would like to send a special Thank You to @FinalPhoenix, who has generously volunteered to help with improving OpenPnP's user interface and overall user experience!</p>
<p class="startli">Many of these changes were suggested by @FinalPhoenix and with her help I hope to make OpenPnP far more enjoyable and easy to use than it has ever been.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Introduction of Navigation Panel</p>
<p class="startli">The Navigation Panel is a new feature that shows a 2D rendered view of your machine and job and allows quick navigation around the various components. You can quickly jog to any location on the machine and you can see a live view of your cameras, nozzles, feeders, boards and placements. Additionally, it makes it very easy to quickly find these objects in the tables below by simply clicking on one of them in the panel.</p>
<p class="startli">This feature is still under heavy development. There are some known bugs and limitations:</p><ul>
<li>When an item is selected, the selection border rendering sometimes gets artifacts from the drag jog line.</li>
<li>Board bottoms are not rendered correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">For more information about this feature, see <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/99">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/99</a>.</p>
<p class="startli">Some things to try are:</p><ul>
<li>Load a job to see a visual representation of the boards and placements.</li>
<li>Use your mouse wheel to zoom in and out.</li>
<li>Mouse over objects to see their names.</li>
<li>Click on various objects to select them and to instantly navigate to them in the tables below.</li>
<li>Click and drag to jog the camera around.</li>
<li>Click on the camera to turn it transparent so you can see what is under it.</li>

<li><p class="startli">Camera Drag Jogging</p>
<p class="startli">You can now click and drag in the camera view to move the camera. When you click and begin to drag, a white line is shown from the current center of the camera to where the camera will go when you release the button. This is in addition to the existing Shift-Click to jog system already in place. It is intended to eventually replace that system.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Navigation View Updates</p>
<p class="startli">Navigation View is a feature that has been in development for some time but has been disabled in the code. It presents a 2D rendered view of the machine from the top down and allows you to quickly move around the machine and get information about objects such as boards, placements, feeders, etc. This feature is still under development and not ready for prime time, but it's become interesting enough that some people may want to try it out. To enable it you need to add -DenableNav=true to your command line.</p>
<p class="startli">Once enabled, there will be a new tab with the Cameras call Navigation. Try loading a job to see what the view shows. You should see boards, placements, feeders, cameras and a red dot for your nozzles. You can zoom in and out with the mouse wheel, mouse over objects to get information, click and drag to jog the machine, and click cameras to turn them transparent. Cameras move and update in real time.</p>
<p class="startli">This feature is going to grow quite a bit in the coming months. This is just a preview.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Event Bus (Developers)</p>
<p class="startli">A simple event bus has been added at Configuration.getBus(). This is currently being tested with the Navigation View above and is intended to further decouple the UI. This new addition is being tested for further use. For more information, see:</p>

<li><p class="startli">Scripting Events</p>
<p class="startli">Scripting Events is a new feature that will be getting a lot of use in the future. This allows scripts to be run when certain things happen in OpenPnP. The scripts are referenced by name and can be of any supported scripting extension. They are found in the scripts/Events directory.</p>
<p class="startli">The feature is used by calling <code>Scripting.on(String eventName, Map&lt;String, Object&gt; globals)</code>.</p>
<p class="startli">As part of this feature, Scripting was moved into Configuration rather than MainFrame, so that it can be used outside of the UI.</p>
<p class="startli">For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Scripting#scripting-events">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Scripting#scripting-events</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Camera.BeforeCapture and Camera.AfterCapture Scripting Events</p>
<p class="startli">The first use of the new feature described above is two events that can be used to control lighting and other complex camera operations. Camera.BeforeCapture is fired before an image is captured and Camera.AfterCapture is fired after the capture is complete.</p>
<p class="startli">By using the scripting events in combination with named Actuators you can control any device on your machine.</p>
<p class="startli">For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Scripting#camerabeforecapture">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Scripting#camerabeforecapture</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Scripting#cameraaftercapture">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Scripting#cameraaftercapture</a></p>

<li><p class="startli">Removed Deprecated LtiCivilCamera and VfwCamera</p>
<p class="startli">LtiCivilCamera and VfwCamera were camera implementations for Mac and Windows. These required native libraries that were out of date and, as far as I know, no longer used. These have been removed in an effort to remove dead code from the project.</p>
<p class="startli">If you were depending on these, please try switching to OpencvCamera or WebcamCamera. See <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/openpnp/JnOMjZWi9C8">https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/openpnp/JnOMjZWi9C8</a> for more information.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md125"></a>
Note: Breaking Change</h2>
<p>The Pick and Place Vacuum Sensing feature was originally released with different configuration variable names. If you installed this version which was released yesterday then your configuration will fail to load when you install this version. To fix it, edit your machine.xml and remove the lines that include <code>vacuum-level-min</code> and <code>vacuum-level-max</code>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md126"></a>
Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Pick and Place Vacuum Sensing</p>
<p class="startli">You can now set a "part on" and "part off" vacuum level on your nozzle tips. The values will be checked during the pick and place operations. Currently only supported in GcodeDriver. See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#vacuum_report_regex">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#vacuum_report_regex</a> and <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver%3A-Command-Reference#vacuum_request_command">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver%3A-Command-Reference#vacuum_request_command</a> for more information.</p>
<p class="startli">Thank you to Matt Brocklehurst for this feature.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Camera View Zoom</p>
<p class="startli">You can now zoom into the camera view using the mouse wheel. The zoom level does not affect what the software sees when taking a picture, it only affects what you see. This can be used to make it easier to pinpoint locations when doing setup work.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Feeder Post Pick Event</p>
<p class="startli">Feeders now support a post pick event which allows for actuation after the pick is complete. This feature is primarily for custom feeders and it is not currently used in the default feeders.</p>
<p class="startli">Thank you to Matt Brocklehurst for this feature.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">GcodeDriver Controller Error Detection</p>
<p class="startli">GcodeDriver can now detect error responses from the controller using the <code>COMMAND_ERROR_REGEX</code>. See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#command_error_regex">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#command_error_regex</a> for more details.</p>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">Nozzle Tip Changer Fourth Move Added</p>
<p class="startli">A fourth move option has been added to the nozzle tip changer to support LitePlacer like hardware configurations. By default the fourth move is cloned from the previous second move upon configuration load, so the change should not result in any new moves for existing configurations.</p>
<p class="startli"><a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/354">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/354</a></p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Logging Changes</p>
<p class="startli">OpenPnP now uses <a href="http://www.tinylog.org/">TinyLog</a> for logging instead of SLF and Log4J. TinyLog is much simpler to configure and far less complex to work with. It has quite a few less features, but based on feedback in <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/333">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/333</a> this was preferred.</p><ul>
<li>Logging now defaults to the INFO level.</li>
<li>The level can be changed from the Log tab and it will be saved.</li>
<li>Log level can be changed on the fly without restarting OpenPnP.</li>
<li>Rotating log files are still created. The naming has changed slightly. The files now rotate after each startup instead of daily.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Camera View Reticle Now Tracks Tool Rotation</p>
<p class="startli">Prior to this change, the camera view reticle / crosshair always tracked the rotation of the camera. Since most cameras don't rotate, this didn't make much sense. The view now tracks the rotation of the currently selected tool, which is almost always the nozzle.</p>
<p class="startli"><a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/347">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/347</a></p>
</li>
<li>Strip Feeder Improvements<ul>
<li>Strip feeder now moves to the correct pick location before the first feed, i.e. when the feed count is 0. This is just a bit of user friendliness that does not really change any functionality. <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/352">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/352</a></li>
<li>Strip feeder auto setup no longer captures or overwrites the Z value. <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/353">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/353</a></li>

<li><p class="startli">GcodeDriver CamTransform</p>
<p class="startli">GcodeDriver now supports cam based Z axes like those used on the OpenBuilds reference design, the RobotDigg head and several other common head designs.</p>
<p class="startli">To use the new transform, see the example configuration below.</p>
<p class="startli">``` &lt;axis name="z" type="Z" home-coordinate="0.0"&gt; &lt;head-mountable-ids class="java.util.HashSet"&gt; &lt;string&gt;69edd567-df6c-495a-9b30-2fcbf5c9742f&lt;/string&gt; &lt;string&gt;169edd567-df6c-495a-9b30-2fcbf5c9742f&lt;/string&gt; &lt;/head-mountable-ids&gt; &lt;transform class="org.openpnp.machine.reference.driver.GcodeDriver$CamTransform" cam-radius="24.0" cam-wheel-radius="9.5" cam-wheel-gap="2.0"&gt; &lt;negated-head-mountable-id&gt;169edd567-df6c-495a-9b30-2fcbf5c9742f&lt;/negated-head-mountable-id&gt; &lt;/transform&gt; &lt;/axis&gt; ```</p>
<p class="startli">In particular, you must define your Z axis head-mountable-ids to your two nozzles, and you must set the negated-head-mountable-id to the secondary nozzle. The parameters for defining the cam are:</p><ul>
<li>cam-radius: The radius of the cam itself.</li>
<li>cam-wheel-radius: The radius of the bearings or wheels at the end of the cams that actually push the axis down.</li>
<li>cam-wheel-gap: The gap, if any, between the cam wheels and the top of the axis which they push down. <br  />

<p class="startli">OpenPnP can now play sounds when a job finishes or fails due to error. This feature also introduces a Signaler interface which will be used in the future to allow for external hardware to be triggered for the same events.</p>
<p class="startli">For more information on this new feature, see: <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Signalers">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/Signalers</a></p>

2016-08-27</h1>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">GcodeDriver Gcode Configuration UI</p>
<p class="startli">You can now configure all Gcode commands and RegExs via the driver configuration wizard found in Machine Setup -&gt; Driver -&gt; GcodeDriver. The wizard has two tabs: Serial and Gcode. In the Gcode tab you can choose the tool you want to configure and the command for that tool. By choosing the Default tool you configure the default set of commands which are used for fallbacks when tool specific commands are not found.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">GcodeDriver Commands Now In CDATA</p>
<p class="startli">GcodeDriver commands are switched to use CDATA now, instead of escaped XML. This makes it easier to include complex regexs that may include XML characters. In general, you don't have to change anything. OpenPnP will update your config the first time you run it. The resulting commands look like:</p>
<p class="startli">``` &lt;command type="CONNECT_COMMAND"&gt; &lt;text&gt;G21&lt;/text&gt; &lt;text&gt;G90&lt;/text&gt; &lt;text&gt;M82&lt;/text&gt; &lt;/command&gt; ```</p>
<p class="startli">Only the data between the [] is considered part of the command.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">GcodeDriver Position Reporting</p>
<p class="startli">GcodeDriver will now read position reports from the controller. This can be used to provide feedback during moves or for controllers that may move externally to OpenPnP. This is a very new feature and is expected to require some iteration before it's perfect. If you run into issues with it, please report them.</p>
<p class="startli">To add position reporting, define a new regex in the format of:</p>
<p class="startli">``` &lt;command type="POSITION_REPORT_REGEX"&gt; &lt;text&gt;&lt;Idle,MPos:(?&lt;x&gt;-?\d+.\d+),(?&lt;y&gt;-?\d+.\d+),(?&lt;z&gt;-?\d+.\d+),(?&lt;rotation&gt;-?\d+.\d+)&gt;&lt;/text&gt; &lt;/command&gt; ```</p>
<p class="startli">Note that the regex contains named groups. The named groups are used to identify the coordinates of each axis you have defined. You should name the groups with the same names in your axes section. In the command above the groups / axes are named x, y, z and rotation.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><p class="startli">GcodeDriver Tool Specific Commands</p>
<p class="startli">GcodeDriver now has the ability to send different commands based on the the tool that that the command is being sent for. This means that you can have different commands for each object on the head such as Nozzles, Cameras, Actuators, etc. Most importantly, you can now have separate pick and place commands for each Nozzle.</p>
<p class="startli">When you first start OpenPnP with this version it will automatically update your configuration and move the existing commands into a default command set. After closing OpenPnP, please inspect your machine.xml to see the changes.</p>
<p class="startli">To specify a specific tool for a command, the following syntax is used: ``` &lt;command head-mountable-id="269edd567-df6c-495a-9b30-2fcbf5c9742f" type="PICK_COMMAND"&gt; &lt;text&gt;M808&lt;/text&gt; &lt;text&gt;M800&lt;/text&gt; &lt;/command&gt; &lt;command head-mountable-id="69edd567-df6c-495a-9b30-2fcbf5c9742f" type="PICK_COMMAND"&gt; &lt;text&gt;M808&lt;/text&gt; &lt;text&gt;M802&ndash;&lt;/text&gt; &lt;/command&gt; ```</p>
<p class="startli">Note that the PICK_COMMAND is specified twice. One for each nozzle. The head-mountable-id specifies which nozzle the command is for.</p>
<p class="startli">OpenPnP will first search for a command that matches the specified tool, and if it cannot find one for the tool then it will default to the command defined without a head-mountable-id.</p>
<p class="startli">The commands that support tool specific codes are:</p><ul>
<li>MOVE_TO_COMMAND</li>
<li>PICK_COMMAND</li>
<li>PLACE_COMMAND</li>
<li>ACTUATE_BOOLEAN_COMMAND</li>
<li>ACTUATE_DOUBLE_COMMAND</li>

<li><p class="startli">GcodeDriver Axis Mapping</p>
<p class="startli">The GcodeDriver now has a system for mapping axes to object on the head, along with a system for transforming coordinates on each axis. This allows more complex head setups than the basic single nozzle, four axis setup. In particular, this system allows for the case where a single Z motor powers two Z axes either in a cam, belt or rack and pinion configuration by specifying a single Z axis with two nozzles mapped to it, along with an appropriate transform. See <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#axis-mapping">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/wiki/GcodeDriver#axis-mapping</a> for more information.</p>

<li><p class="startli">OpenBuilds Driver Rotation Improvements</p>
<p class="startli">The OpenBuilds Driver now treats the rotary axes as rotary axes, instead of linear ones. This means that it will choose to turn the opposite direction if that is the faster way to reach a given position. In other words, if you are trying to move from 355 degrees to 10 degrees it will counterclockwise 15 degrees, passing through 360 degrees instead of clockwise 345 degrees passing through 180 degrees.</p>
<p class="startli">This greatly improves performance related to the recent change to treat all rotation moves as solo.</p>

<p class="startli">This is a major rewrite of the JobProcessor, which is the code the handles the actual running of jobs. The purpose of this rewrite is to address many issues that have cropped up over the years in the JobProcessor, primarily around error handling and retry. The following changes are included:</p><ul>
<li>Feed Retry: You can specify a retry count (default 3) in the feeder configuration and if a feed operation fails on a given feeder the operation will retry that many times before disabling the feeder and advancing to the next available one. If no more feeders are available for the part the feed operation fails and the user is notified. <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/206">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/206</a></li>
<li>Job Error Recovery: If any part of a job fails the user is now presented a dialog offering the options Retry, Skip, Pause to resolve it. No more "The job will be paused" leaving the system broken. Retry will attempt to re-run the previous task. Skip will skip processing the current placement. Pause pauses the job and hides the dialog so that the user can make configuration changes to attempt to resolve the error. The job may be continued with the Run or Step button.</li>
<li>Home After Job Complete: When a job completes normally the machine will return to home. <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/76">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/76</a></li>
<li>Pre and Post Job Machine Cleanup: Before a job starts and after it either finishes or is aborted, if any nozzles are holding a part the part will be discarded. <a href="https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/102">https://github.com/openpnp/openpnp/issues/102</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="startli">Note to developers: The code and API for this feature is considered alpha quality and is expected to change.

<li><p class="startli">Show Camera Names in All Camera View</p>
<p class="startli">When the "All Cameras" view is selected, the name of each camera will be shown in in a little box in the bottom left of the view. This makes it easier to know what you are looking at when you have multiple cameras in action.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">FPS Limit Option in OpenCvCamera</p>
<p class="startli">You can now set an FPS limit in the OpenCvCamera wizard. The default is 24. This is helpful to limit CPU usage on a machine with high resolution cameras.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Removed Bottom Vision API from VisionProvider</p>
<p class="startli">Before the Bottom Vision feature was complete it had been stubbed into the VisionProvider API. Since Bottom Vision is it's own first level object now this is no longer needed, so it has been removed. Existing implementations should move to either ReferenceBottomVision or to their own specific implementation of PartAlignment.</p>

<p class="startli">You can now set a crop width and height on your camera. The crop is applied from the center, so setting a crop of 200x200 will make the output from the camera only the center 200x200 pixels. This is useful for when you have a high resolution camera but only care about a small portion of it. Cropping decreases the amount of data that is required to be processed and cuts down CPU and memory usage.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Moved the jog controls from their dialog to the main window.</p>
<p class="startli">The jog controls are now always available and have been modified to take up less vertical space. The large START / STOP button has been replaced with a smaller "Power" button in the jog controls and the jog increment slider has been changed to vertical instead of horizontal and also integrated into the jog controls.</p>
<p class="startli">The end result is that the jog controls now take up about the same amount of space as the big START button + increment slider used to except now they are visible all the time.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Changed Nozzle.pick() to Nozzle.pick(Part) and added Nozzle.getPart()</p>
<p class="startli">This change allows the Nozzle to be aware of what Part it has picked and also allows callers to find out the same. This is used in SimulatedUpCamera to render the Part, will be used in the Nav View to render parts, is used in controlling movement speed based on Part speed and will be used in future improvements to the part discard bin.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Part speed is now enforced in Nozzle.moveTo instead of randomly all over the program.</p>

<li><p class="startli">Add a Discard Location to machine.</p>
<p class="startli">Discard location can be configured in Machine Settings -&gt; Machine. The Discard location is used as a dumping area for parts when an error occurs.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add Discard button to Special Commands window.</p>
<p class="startli">Allows you to manually discard any part that is currently picked on the selected nozzle.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Add Pick button to Parts panel.</p>
<p class="startli">The Pick button allows you to pick the selected part from the first available feeder.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Remove Pick and Place buttons from Special Commands window.</p>
<p class="startli">This functionality was misnamed in that it did not actually pick or place a part, it was just used to turn vacuum on and off. Pick functionality is now handled by the Pick buttons on the Parts and Feeders panels and Place functionality is handled by the Discard button. </p>
